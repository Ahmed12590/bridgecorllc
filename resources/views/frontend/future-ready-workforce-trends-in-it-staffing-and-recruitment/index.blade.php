                                    organizations to access diverse skill sets from around the world.</span></p>
                            <h2><b>Gig Economy and Flexible Staffing Models:</b></h2>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gig economy is influencing how organizations
                                    structure their IT workforce. Flexible staffing models, such as contract-based
                                    or project-based employment, are gaining prominence. IT staffing agencies are
                                    adapting to this trend by offering solutions that cater to the need for
                                    flexibility in staffing, enabling organizations to scale their teams based on
                                    project requirements.</span></p>
                            <h2><b>Focus on Diversity and Inclusion:</b></h2>

                            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the
